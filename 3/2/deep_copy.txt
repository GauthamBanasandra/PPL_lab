How to implement deep copy in java?

Here is an example of Deep Copy implementation. This is the same example of Shallow Copy implementation and hence I didnt write the Subject and CopyTest classes as there is no change in them.


class Student implements Cloneable {
  //Contained object
  private Subject subj;

  private String name;

  public Subject getSubj() {
	return subj;
  }

  public String getName() {
	return name;
  }

  public void setName(String s) {
	name = s;
  }

  public Student(String s, String sub) {
	name = s;
	subj = new Subject(sub);
  }

  public Object clone() {
	//Deep copy
	Student s = new Student(name, subj.getName());
	return s;
  }
}

Output is:
Original Object: John - Algebra
Cloned Object: John - Algebra
Original Object after it is updated: Dan - Physics
Cloned Object after updating original object: John - Algebra
